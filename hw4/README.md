Here's a breakdown of the code:

Variable Declarations:

Led1, Led2, Led3, and Led4 store the pin numbers for the four LEDs.
Poten stores the pin number for the potentiometer.
Setup Function:

setup() is called once when the Arduino starts.
pinMode() is used to set the LED pins as OUTPUT and the potentiometer pin as INPUT.
Serial.begin(9600) initializes serial communication for debugging purposes.
Loop Function:

loop() is the main execution loop that runs continuously.
analogRead(A5) reads the analog value from the potentiometer and stores it in valorPotenciometro.
Serial.println(valorPotenciometro) prints the potentiometer value to the Serial Monitor.
LED Control:

The code uses a series of if and else if statements to control the LEDs based on the potentiometer value.
The LEDs are turned on or off in a progressive manner depending on the potentiometer value ranges.
Make sure to connect the LEDs and potentiometer to the correct pins on your Arduino board. The potentiometer will provide analog input values in the range of 0 to 1023, and the code maps different ranges to control the LEDs accordingly.
